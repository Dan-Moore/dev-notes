# Hello, World!

This is my first blog post using **MDX** and **Next.js**. MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content, making it powerful for creating interactive blog posts.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the best of markdown and JSX:

- **Simplicity** of markdown for content writers
- **Power** of React components when needed
- **Flexibility** to create dynamic content

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting('MDX Reader'));
```

## What's Next?

In future posts, we'll explore more MDX features and how to create interactive content for your blog. Stay tuned!
